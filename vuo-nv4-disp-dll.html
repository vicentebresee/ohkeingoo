                            <p>So several weeks ago I was using Hulu when all of a sudden my laptop froze. I tried rebooting it, and the BIOS text that scrolls during startup (pre windows initialization) was all gibberish. Then when the windows loading screen came up, the colors were all distorted and my screen was divided in two (width wise) so that I know had two duplicate views. I then restarted my laptop again to receive the BSOD which indicated an infinite loop and an error with "nv4_disp.dll". Upon restarting AGAIN Hey guys. For the longest time, whenever I would put CS in fullscreen mode, it would always crash and then give me an error message saying "nv4_disp display driver has stopped working normally" The only way around this error I found was to put my game in windowed mode, and even then it sometimes crashed. I've gotten so many 7 day bans from my computer crashing and not being able to re-join. It seems that CS is the only game I get this error on. I can play Skyrim, Saints Row, and GTA in fullscree. I can't seem to make XP run DOS games, it goes to a black screen then my video driver crashes nv4_disp.dll how do I fix that, I generally don't run dos games in XP, i usually use a source port or dosbox, but would like to know how to at least make them work in the OS My specs: i7 3770 gtx 970 4gb 4gb DDR3 Windows XP 32 bit 128gb samsung evo ssd 2tb secondary hdd 250gb My game keeps crashing every time I start up a heist (The black screen) This started happening when Day 9 dropped for LampL Heres the crash log Sun Oct 29 22:51:09 2017 Application has crashed: C++ exception string "lib/managers/hud/hudteammate.lua" :1253: attempt to call method 'child' (a nil value) SCRIPT STACK set_ability_icon() lib/managers/hudmanagerpd2.lua:556 set_teammate_grenades() lib/managers/hudmanagerpd2.lua:562 _set_grenade() lib/managers/playermanager.lua:4112 _interna.

My computer suddenly outputs no audio. I have speakers plugged into the light green jack on the back of the tower, which produced sound until only a few moments ago. So far I've tried a pair of headphones which also give no sound. I used Microsoft's Fixit program, which did not solve the issue. I've checked the device manager to see if the audio device was enabled. There are several items under audio devices, all of which appear to be enabled. I'm not sure what I can do, but here is the informa.

Every once in a while, my desktop would get a blue screen after it's been on for a while.

So, I bought Witcher 2 recently and it runs pretty solid at about 60 FPS most of the time on mediumish settings. But there's this bizarre stutter in Geralt's movements, as if the FPS drops momentarily on only him. This only seems to happen when outdoors. I'm not even sure if its an FPS problem, it almost looks as if his model is just tripping forward slightly whenever he runs, as if the animation skips a frame. Not only that, but I'm having trouble with textures loading slowly. During convers. aswtdi.sys (avast!

Hi guys/girls, Basically, my services.exe is deciding to use upwards of 80% of my CPU constantly. The only major changes I've done in the last few hours is the installation of new video card drivers (went to load portal1, got a blue screen due to nv4_disp.dll -- saw a solution was updating drivers, and therefore updated drivers); since the restart after installing the drivers, I noticed my computer going crazy-slow. I checked the task manager to find services.exe using So I started having some problems a while ago with my graphic drivers. When 3D playing games my screen frezes for a sec then it goes black, then returns to run normaly for another 2 secs then freezes again (note: this only happens during 3D games 2D games work fine. I have tried almost everything some of it includes: clean driver update, safe mode wipe + update, OS reinstall(multiple times), i've checked for overheating and it runs at normal temps, i scaned my comp for any threath. Hey a mate told me you guys are a friendly bunch to assist in the exciting yet for the unexperienced worryingly picky process of upgrading my PC! I was told to post specs here and some things I've been thinking of. The main use will be for gaming, and I'd only be running at 1024 x 768 as I have a monitor with a fantastic sound hook up that is centered around this small monitor (Inbuilt speakers with numerous externals.). I have another 1280 x 1024 one but that'd be rarely used. I think Hi all, Inspired by a recent front-page post about how canyourunit.com is a sham and shouldn't be relied upon and their suggested upgrades are all advertisements, I wanted to post my spec's and ask for suggestions on upgrades and where to get them. First of all, I want this thing to be able to run games on high settings for the next 2-3 years, but I don't need a complete tank. Right now I defer on games like Skyrim and Assassin's Creed just because I know they will be incredibly frustrating. PC is freezing in what seems to be an arbitrary fashion. I hit the reset button and reboot and things are fine until the next "arbitrary" freeze. Sometimes it will run for days or a week or more, sometimes a few hours. On occasion, there will be a notice on POST that the proc is overheated. I have cleaned with air the internals and re-done the thermal paste on the proc, but no joy (or rather very little). Just got a little app from CPUID that shows this: This helps. </p>
