I suspect I'll need a proper overlay to enable both sides but I'm not sure how to go about finding or making. MikroElektronika produces a wide range of development tools, compilers and books for various microcontroller families. I'm trying to interface a Mikroelectronica UV3 click board UV sensor (see here (https://www.mikroe.com/uv-3-click)) to an Arduino UNO. To my understanding its supposed to act like any other I2C device, but i'm stumped on the ACK (acknowledge) pin; where do I connect that to? amp#x200B; My SCL and SDA pins follow the typical pull-up configuration for any other I2C device. amp#x200B; Any help would be appreciated. Compilers. Frequently asked questions about compilers. Programmer/Debugger. Have a question about programmer/debugger ? Find an answer here. Hardware. So I have an Airquality sensor for a mikroelectronika board and click board adapter so I can put it on the arudino. The problem is that the mikroelectronica gives code examples for its own compliers which is in like a mpkg file which aurdino does not recongize, and mikroelectrinka does not give out its compliers for free. So I was confused on how I should try to move the code over. An idea I have is can I open the file in notepad and transfer the code to the arudino ide, and wish something.

Hi all, I just spent 4 hours trying to program a Atmega32 using a dev board I bought from mikroE and a AVR-ISP-MK2 programmer from Olimex. I am using AVR studio 4.15. https://www.olimex.com/Products/AVR/Programmers/AVR-ISP-MK2/open-source-hardware I know the programmer is suitable for AVR Studio 4.7 and higher.

MikroElektronika is a renowned producer of a wide range of development tools and compilers for various microcontroller families. I am making a simple PID motor control platform with a pic24ep512gp202 uC. m just curious if anyone knows a way to display plots of the system response on a screen from the microcontroller? I use LCD's to display numerical data like P gain = X or RPM = Y. But I want to actually show a plot. So if I give the uC a set point of 2000 rpm I want to see a plot of the rpm of the motors over time so that I can see how it responds.

Has anyone here used this ( board? I'm taking my first class in computer engineering/embedded programing, and this is the board they made us buy. And in all honesty, its horrible to use. I'm not learning anything, there're no tutorials anywhere, the documentation is nonexistent. And the professor doesn't teach. We were given example code, I ran it last week, it worked. Today it worked the first time I ran it, now its not working. Mikroelektronika spol. s r. o. Address. Dráby 849 566 01 Vysoké Mýto The Czech Republic.

In my apprenticeship we also did PIC programming on this board in C As a project, me and a colleague programmed TicTacToe on this board with the GLCD and touchscreen which I quite enjoyed. Because of that I want to try a little bit more in that field at home. The board we used is quite expensive (you also need the PRO version of the software) so I wondered is there some cheaper board to do what I want? I only want to programm a GLCD with a touchscreen Mikroe, Belgrade, Serbia. 62K likes. MikroElektronika ( ) produces a wide range of development boards, accessory boards.

Now that that is out of the way. It seems like I have been hearing a lot lately on social media, TV and talk radio about people leaving their kids in their car and the child dying for heat exhaustion. This morning as I'm listening to the radio on my way to work they are talking about it again, and an idea pops into my head for a solution. So I have this idea and it requires building a prototype and developing. I need an HMI for a big project, and anything less than 240x128 I'm afraid won't do. What I really want is something similar to the display development board mikroelektronika ( makes. If that's floating around here for sale, that would be perfect. But I'll settle for anything I can work with. Given the scope of work I have to do besides just getting this screen to work, I'd like to have the most ready-to-use solution around.
